# Events Module

- The events module allows us to work with events in Node.js
- An event is an action or an occurrence that has happend in our application that we can respond to
- Using the events module, we can dispatch our own custom events and respond to those custom events in a non-blocking manner

# Events Module - Scenario

Let's say you're feeling hungry and head out to Dominos to have pizza.
At the counter, you place your order for a pizza.
When you place the order, the line cook sees the order on the screen and bakes the pizza for you

_Order being placed is the event_
_Baking a pizza is a response to that event_

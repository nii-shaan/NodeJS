# Path Module

- The path module provide utilities for working with file and directory paths

# node: Protocol

- Makes it perfectly clear that the import is a Node.js builtin module

# Callbacks

- In JavaScript, function are first class objects
- A function can be passsed as an argument to a function
- A function can also be returned as values from other functions

# Types of callback

- Synchronous callbacks
- Asynchronous callbacks

# Synchronous callbacks

- A callback which is executed immediately is called a synchronous callback

# Asynchronous callbacks

- A callback that is often used to continue or resume code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed
- Callbacks are used to delay the execution of a function until a particular time or event has occured
- In Node.js have an asynchronous nature to prevent blocking of execution
- Ex. reading data from a file, fetching data from database or handling a network request
